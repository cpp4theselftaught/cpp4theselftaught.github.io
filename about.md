This is the new C++ for the self-taught website.

C++ for the self-taught is currently focused on developing the Rubicon ASN.1 compiler. You can follow the development of this open source project, started on a whim by Ronald Landheer-Cieslak, by following this site.

More to come - this new site was developed initially because the WordPress site this was hosted on broke down for the fourth time and I (rlc) was fed up with putting it back up. Stay tuned.
