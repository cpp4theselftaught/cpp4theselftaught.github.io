There is, however, one encoding in there that I happen to like for its mix of efficiency and simplicity: it's called DER, for Distinguished Encoding Rules, and is a subset of BER, the Basic Encoding Rules, both of which are defined in X.690 (along with the Canonical Encoding Rules).rnrnDER is a nice encoding in that it consistently encodes values as type-length-value types which the values themselves can be sets or sequences of type-length-value tuples. Values are encoded in their smallest possible representation in whole octets. This makes DER reasonably easy to decode.rnrnHence, I replied with rnhttps://twitter.com/blytkerchan/status/891797275768479744rnI.e. the problem is in the schema language, which defines innumerable string types which can all be represented in the same way (as an <code>std::vector</code>).
