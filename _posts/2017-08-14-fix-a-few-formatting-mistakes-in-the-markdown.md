    Fix a few formatting mistakes in the markdow
    
    nSo, this is the first time I'm actually looking at this stuff on a real computer, and I noticed the formatting for the markdown was broken. That's easy enough to fix!
    
    Code won't compile any better because of this, but I still have some code to commit on my phone, so I'll do that before trying to get anything to compile...
