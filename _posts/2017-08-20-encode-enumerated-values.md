    Encode enumerated values
    
    Next step will be to encode bit strings. We'll need to decide on anrepresentation of those first, though, as the decoder doesn't have anrepresentation other than a pair of iterators and a bits-to-ignorencount at the moment.nOf course, were don't actually need anything more than a pair ofniterators and a bits-to-ignore count...
