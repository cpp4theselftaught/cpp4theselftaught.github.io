    Started work on the compiler
    
    I've renamed the preprocessor to asn1p to be more consistent with whatnthe compiler will be called (asn1c) and started work on the compiler byncreating a listener to gather information from the parse tree.
    
    I've also added a dependency for my little tracing library (which I'venput on GitHub for this project, and made open source) as that will helpnwith outputting traces etc.
