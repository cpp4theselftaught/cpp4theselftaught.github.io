I have started the process of back-porting the posts of the previous version by exporting the posts from the WordPress database (and running them through a script). All those posts are in [the repo](https://github.com/cpp4theselftaught/cpp4theselftaught.github.io/tree/master/_drafts).

I *will not* back-port all the posts: most of them are available on [my blog](http://rlc.vlinder.ca) anyway. I *will* back-port the ones about Rubicon that were not simply the commit messages for the project.

**UPDATE**: I have finished triaging the posts from the previous version of the site. There are three posts that will re-appear on this site with their original dates and contents. The other posts either live on my blog or remain available in "raw" format in the repo.
