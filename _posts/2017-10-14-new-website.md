OK, so the C++ for the self-taught website broke down for the fourth time in a row, and I was pretty much done with that .... (the word you're looking for starts with a 'c' and ends with a 'p' -- don't think anything too vulgar here).

I have a bit of work to do on the layout of the site, but this should be easier to maintain from my phone than a WordPress site that keeps breaking down.

In any case, this is where I will write down my thoughts on C++ development and why I'm doing what I'm doing in the Rubicon project. I will back-port at least the posts about Rubicon. Older C++ for the self-taught posts are available at [my blog](http://rlc/vlinder.ca).
